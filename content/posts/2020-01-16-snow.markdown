How does it snow in the -30s? How does frost appear inside our new triple-paned windows[^1] when there's no humidity within the house to condense?

I'm reading about climate change and the great derangement[^2] of how it doesn't show up in our literature, like we are pretending the world isn't changing, but the brutality of a winter the way I remember it being as a kid in Winnipeg makes it, not hard to believe, but hard to reconcile our immediate feelings with those of the world with the knowledge that it's all going to hell. It doesn't feel here like there's a warming problem. But there is. The way we have to take the word of people who know better, who see farther than usis great and terrifying. I fear that we aren't good at seeing other perspectives, people never are. This problem of individual and collective action is the problem I always have and always will be dealing with. But if I am siding with [the egg](https://japanamerica.blogspot.ca/2009/02/haruki-murakami-on-side-of-egg.html) doesn't that mean I am trusting what I see and feel, more than the bigger consensus on the reasons behind things? I suppose this is why I should stick to fiction instead of my ways of destroying eveything for everyone.
