It is cold here today. So very cold[^1]. We drove in on the bypass road, here it's called the Henday after some white dude[^2], and not too far past our turn-off there was an accident slowing the traffic down. 

Our wolf watched an Imperial fire burn down the world and he sang -- in negation mostly. No. No. No. Our tuneless chorus.

Stuck in the traffic, letting in big-rigs, eventually arriving to be our little dented cogs in the machine it's hard to pretend to be happy, but it's hard being unhappy too. 

[1]: -34C at 8:30am.

[2]: Anthony Henday was a Hudson's Bay Company man.
