Tomorrow I finish my month-long move down to Nanaimo for [my new job](http://librarianaut.com/2014/08/25/not-quite-a-comeback/). By this time next week though, I'll be on vacation.

I hope I like Nanaimo better than Campbell River. I feel kind of bad for not liking it here. There are some very nice people in this town, but nothing ever really clicked for me. I will miss the folks from Coho Books.

In Nanaimo there are comic & game shops I'll be able to bike to. The ferry to Vancouver is way closer and easier. I know a bunch of people there already (yes, most of them are librarians) so maybe I won't have to live on the internet quite so much.

Back when I decided to get an MLIS it was basically so I wouldn't be stuck in Winnipeg. And I'm still not stuck anywhere, so it seems my mission is being accomplished. Go me.
